# Do you know the Game of Life ? 

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state.

The analogies of the Game of Life with the development, decline, and alterations of a colony of microorganisms bring it closer to simulation games that mimic real-life processes.

# The rules : 

- Birt : A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive in the next generation.
- Survival : A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives to the next generation.
- Death by underpopuplation : A live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies.
- Death bu overpopulation : A live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies.

# Patterns :

Various patterns emerge from these simple rules. You can discover some on them on my portfolio. 

The games od Life demonstrates how complex patterns can emerge from dimple rules, making it a fascinating example of emergence and self-organization. 

Despite its very simple rules, it is Turing complete. 

# Advanced features

In my version, I had some feature to play with it. 

- Upload an image to make it alive

- Bring any text to life 

- Enjoy drawing random shape
