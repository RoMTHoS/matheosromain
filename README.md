# Do you know the Game of Life ? 

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state.

The analogies of the Game of Life with the development, decline, and alterations of a colony of microorganisms bring it closer to simulation games that mimic real-life processes.

# The rules : 

- Birt : A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive in the next generation.
- Survival : A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives to the next generation.
- Death by underpopuplation : A live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies.
- Death bu overpopulation : A live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies.


          <h3>Patterns</h3>
          <p>Various patterns emerge from these simple rules:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Still lifes:</strong> Patterns that don't change (e.g.,
              Block, Beehive)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Oscillators:</strong> Patterns that repeat (e.g., Blinker,
              Toad)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Spaceships:</strong> Patterns that move across the grid
              (e.g., Glider)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Several pre-made patterns are available from the tools menu for you
            to experiment with.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Game of Life demonstrates how complex patterns can emerge from
            simple rules, making it a fascinating example of emergence and
            self-organization.

          <p>Despite its very simple rules, it is Turing-complete.</p>
